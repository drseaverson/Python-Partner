# Python-Partner
Python Partner is a website project that I created as my final project for my Intro to Web Application Development course during college. This project consisted of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application of our choice and design from scratch.

Including some pictures of a few pages of the webpage, a sample of the JavaqScript code used to create the website can be viewed [here](/Images/Code%20Examples/JavaScript_Example.png)
